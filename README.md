# Getting Started
https://grumpy-puce-narwhal.cyclic.app

The link above takes you to the login page where you will click the login button to access your account via Google login.

From that point you will be taken to a dashboard which will show you your clients and allow you to view their details page. In the details page, you will be able to create appointments which have a date, service, time to perform service, and price of service parameter. 

You will also be able to delete clients from your list. Appointments can be individually deleted as well.

# Next Steps
- I would like to have a google calendar API to set appointments to your calendar from the user side. This would also include a "calendly-style" link so that clients can book their own appointments from a user's website.

- make some cosmetic changes to make it feel more like an enterprise level software

- create iterations as any enterprise SaaS company would for their clients.
